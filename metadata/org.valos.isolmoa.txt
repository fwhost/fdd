Summary:Isolmoa
Description:
Isolmoa is a two-player abstract strategy board game based on the Isola game. It is played on a board which is initially filled with squares. Both players have one piece.

To begin, each player places his/her piece. Next, each turn of play is composed of two actions:

    Moving his/her piece to a neighboring position
    Removing any square with no piece on it.

The goal of the game is to block the opponent by destroying all the squares which surround him before being blocked yourself.
