Summary:AnySoftKeyboard: Pali
Description:
You may need a special font to display the diacritics properly: this would require root and instructions are here.

Standard QWERTY keyboard layout with Pali and Sanskrit diacritics and Pali dictionary (about 75,000 of the most common word-forms in the Pali texts).

Install AnySoftKeyboard first, then select the desired layout from AnySoftKeyboard's Settings->Keyboards menu
.
