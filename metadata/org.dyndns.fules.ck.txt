Summary:Compass Keyboard
Description:
International keyboard

CompassKeyboard's main goal is to enable entering any character (including international characters and symbols of computer languages as well) with the same layouts. Default layouts support Latin- and Cyrillic-based and Greek character sets: user-definable external layouts are supported as well. For entering a plain character just swipe a key to some direction: for entering some accented ones, do a big swipe across the whole keyboard. Depending on the direction of the big swipe, you can choose different sets of accenting. For choosing a different layout, do a big swipe from the top-left corner of the keyboard across to bottom-down, and choose a layout from L0 to L6 (L0:Latin, L1:Cyrillic, L2:Greek, L3-L6:Custom). To get a visual feedback about the symbol you are about to enter, visit the entries 'Feedback/Normal feedback' and 'Feedback/Password feedback' in the Settings menu, and choose either Toast or Highlight.
