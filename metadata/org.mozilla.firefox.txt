Anti-features: Non-free Addons: The license of the addons/modules on addons.mozilla.org may be seen in the version notes of the addon and often the license is Custom or other non-free. However there is no such license info for most apps from the marketplace. Tracking: Stats are sent back regularly to the developers, but that can be disabled via settings.
