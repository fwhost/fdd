Summary:Chinese Checkers
Description:
The objective is to be first to race one's pieces across the gameboard. Each player has ten pieces. Players take turns moving a single piece, either by moving one step to an adjacent unoccupied space or by jumping in one of any number of available consecutive hops over other single pieces. There is no capturing, so hopped pieces remain active on the gameboard. In other languages : jeu de Dames chinoises (Fr), Halma (De), Kinaschack spel (Se), Damas chinas (Es), Dama chinese (It), 中國跳棋, 中国のチェッカー, Китайские шашки.
