Summary:Helsinki Testbed Viewer 2.0
Description:
With the application, you can, for example, view the real-time rain radar or current wind speed and direction. The maps cover the Southern Finland.

The data is copyright the Helsinki Testbed Project and the app has nothing to do with that project: it's only a client.

A proprietary ad library was removed.
