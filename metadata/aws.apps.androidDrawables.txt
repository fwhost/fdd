Summary:Android Resources
Description:
This application will list all public and private Android resources (i.e. resources located under android.R.* and under com.android.internal.R.*) for the current device. If the resource is a drawable or a colour the background colour of the list can be changed to see how it looks next to a different colour. Internal resources (anything under 'com.android._internal_.R') are not guaranteed to be in all devices/Android versions. Do not reference them directly in your application or it will crash on untested device configurations.
