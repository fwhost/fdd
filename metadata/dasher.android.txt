Summary:Dasher
Description:
Dasher is an information-efficient, text-entry interface, driven by a natural continuous steering of the cursor into boxes representing the letter you want to input.

Dasher is especially useful for text-entry wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used â€” for example,

    when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;
    when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker);
    on a palmtop computer;
    on a wearable computer.
.
