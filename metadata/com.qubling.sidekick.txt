Summary:CPAN Sidekick
Description:
Every super Perl developer needs a sidekick. Ask a Perl developer what her favorite feature of the language is and chances are good that the answer is CPAN. CPAN Sidekick brings all the great information and documentation of the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network to your phone.

    Search for CPAN modules
    See search results with the author's picture, module abstract, ratings, and favorites
    Tap on individual results to see the documentation for that module
    Tap on the module header on documentation to see the release details
    Follow links within the documentation to see the documentation for other modules
    Any link to something other than a module will work, but will go to a browser, even if that link is within CPAN
    Two panel view for tablets
