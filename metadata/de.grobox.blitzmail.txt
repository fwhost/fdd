Summary:BlitzMail
Description:
BlitzMail is an Android app that allows you to set up your email account once and then use it to send emails or short notes to an address of your choice. This comes in handy when you need to send a lot of things via email, because you are in a low connectivity area (e.g. subway) and want to remember things to look at later.

It also works when you are offline. BlitzMail then queues your emails and allows you to send them later when you have connectivity again.

The SMTP password is stored encrypted with a built-in key and salted with your device ID. This is not fully secure, but should provide reasonable protection for your password.
