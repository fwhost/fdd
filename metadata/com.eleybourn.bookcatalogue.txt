Summary:Book Catalogue
Description:
N.B The GoodReads integration won't work as there aren't any API keys in the source code to make it work. If you are switching between different apk signatures it is a good idea to export your list before uninstalling.

This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books. Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode if you have Barcode Scanner installed. In the case of the last two methods, information including cover images is sought on the internet meaning you can have a thorough record of a book in as little as 30 seconds.

One thing to watch out for is that in rare case, barcodes do not contain ISBN numbers. This will usually apply to older trade or pulp books and a barcode is often also present inside the front cover. If no ISBN is present a search for the author's name may still give results.
