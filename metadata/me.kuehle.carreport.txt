Description:
Get an idea of how much your car costs. Simply enter the costs after refueling and get nice reports. These are:

    Fuel consumption
    Fuel price
    Average costs of the car per day, month and year

You can pinch-to-zoom in the graph and click on a point in it so see its values. This app can manage refuelings, other costs such as repairs and costs which occur repeatedly such as taxes. You can use the app with several cars concurrently.

N.B. Newer versions of this app (starting at 3.0) use the non-free google play services library.
