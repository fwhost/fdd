Subsonic is a cross-platform FOSS media server that's capable of indexing very large media collections. The server can transcode if necessary so that the app can play files that your device may not normally support.

The app is set up to access a demo server on the internet for trying it out. In order to use this app with your own Subsonic server beyond a trial period, a key must be obtained by making a donation. (A key isn't required to use the Supersonic variant.)

Recent versions of this app depend on the non-free Google Play Services library.
