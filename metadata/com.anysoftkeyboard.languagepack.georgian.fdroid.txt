Summary:AnySoftKeyboard: Georgian
Description:
N.B You may need to install Georgian fonts. This process would require root. We have a package for them: Georgian Fonts Installer.

Install AnySoftKeyboard first, then select the desired layout from AnySoftKeyboard's Settings->Keyboards menu. See the Google Play description of com.anysoftkeyboard.languagepack.georgian_full for more tips.

This package is a hybrid, using keyboards from the source code page and dictionaries from the texts of the literature portal lib.ge (editor an co-owner Giorgi Kekelidze) and published with his permission. Be sure to mention that this package uses a different dictionary if visiting the issue tracker
.
