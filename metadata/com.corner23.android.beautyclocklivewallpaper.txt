Summary:Beauty Clock
Description:
Bijin Tokei is a genre of wallpaper that is popular in East Asia. Every minute the wallpaper changes to a picture of a pretty girl holding an object that displays the time.

This app will download the pictures for every minute from your chosen site without caching them but it will check if images already exist in sdcard/BeautyClock/pic/site/ and the scheme is always aabb.jpg where aa is the hour and bb is the minute. In this way, you can have the app display any images that you want.
