Summary:ePUBator
Description:
Extracts text from a PDF file and puts it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.
    PDF extraction is based on iText library http://itextpdf.com/ released under the AGPL license.
    Doesn't need internet connection.
    Doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net.
    Extracts text (no text in pictures or in raster PDF).
    Tries to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
    Tries to extract the table of contents if present (or creates a dummy TOC).
    Doesn't extract the font size and style.
    Works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
    Can fail extraction (5 of 358 books with v0.8.1 on the author's Atrix).
    IS MADE FOR BOOKS, NOT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PDF (DON'T ASK IT TOO MUCH).

In the event of crash, unexpected stoppages or insufficient memory try setting Page per file to 1 and/or disable the extraction of images and try again (sometimes helps).
