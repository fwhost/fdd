Summary:Droid Draw
Description:
Control a pen holding Android and create complex shapes using part of the LOGO programming language. Not sure what Turtle Graphics and LOGO programming is? The original Turtle Graphics allowed a user to enter commands which represented what would be drawn out out on a Cartesian plane. Droid Draw brings this same functionality to Android users.

Not sure what to do? Make sure to check out the help section in the app or visit the website. There is information on how to use the app and what every command does.
