Summary:Debian Kit
Description:
Install Debian alongisde your system

It's possible to install a complete Linux software stack on Android devices, e.g. by adding a chroot environment as others already have implemented. This kit does 2 things differently: firstly, it installs a Debian file system side-by-side to the Android file system. In order to access anything thatâ€™s accessible from Android also from the Debian side. And secondly, the Debian bootstrap is executed on the Device itself without any help of a larger PC, Android debugging bridge or similar.
