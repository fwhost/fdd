Summary:build.prop Editor
Description:
Edit your build.prop file easily. This file resides in /system and contains all the info that identifies the capabilities of your device. After editing an entry you must press a button in the top right hand corner that isn't very visible and changes may not register in the list until you re-enter the app.

Don't mess with this unless you know what you are doing and are confident that you can restore a backup via adb shell in recovery.

Requires root: Yes. The build.prop is located in /system.
