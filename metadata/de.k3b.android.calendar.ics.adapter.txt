Summary:Calendar ICS adapter
Description:
Use a filemanager (i.e. OI File Manager), emailclient (i.e. K-9 Mail) or bluetooth to import or export android calendar entries via *.ics or *.ical files or attachments of type text/calendar.

The android.calendar.ics.adapter has no gui of its own. If you open an event from the android calendar you can choose between "view event" and "send event to ...". If you open an event from file/attachment you get a prepopulated "add to calender-form".

android.calendar.ics.adapter is a fork of Add to calendar that uses the ical4j library.
